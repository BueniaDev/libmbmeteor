Game Boy Advance emulation library, sorta

The goal here is to be both fast and accurate (like libmbGB and melonDS). But also, you know, to have a fun challenge... ;)

# Plans

## Near-term

Improve existing Game Boy Advance support

Implement battery saving

## Medium-term

Savestate support

Implement GBA addons (GBA RTC, GBA Wireless Adapter, etc.)

## Long-term

Nintendo DS support
